### Introduction

A couple of years ago I got interested in Ethereum. My favourite programming language at the time was Elixir (by the way, Elixir is still my favourite language). My first contribution to the Ethereum community was [Ethereumex](https://github.com/exthereum/ethereumex) - Elixir JSON-RPC client for the Ethereum. In this post, I'll describe its evolution. I have got a couple of other open source projects that I wrote or was a part of the team. But I want to describe the evolution of Ethereumex because this small library is a good example of a hobby project that was written on the weekend and then got relatively popular in the community.

### History

From the first days of the project, I tried to follow community guides of good open source projects. One of the things I did for this is I added `CHANGELOG.md` file to easier track changes between versions. I'll use this file to describe the development of Ethereumex

#### 0.1.x

As described in the introduction, the first version (`0.1.0`) was written literally over the weekend at the beginning of the summer of 2017. This version was pretty simple: JSON-RPC methods were generated by a macro. Unfortunately, automatic code generation has its downsides. The only difference between those methods was their names. They all accepted a list of params.

Surprisingly, some people used this version, I even received [one pull request](https://github.com/exthereum/ethereumex/pull/2) that was published in `0.1.1` version.

#### 0.2.0 - 0.3.x

In October of 2017, I decided to take a week-long holiday. On this holiday I rewrote Ethereumex from scratch. I got rid of automatic code generation, public API methods were defined using Elixir's behaviours. There is a [detailed post called "Elixir macros are evil (sometimes)"](https://www.badykov.com/elixir/2017/10/18/macros-are-evil/) about this rewrite on my blog.

The rewritten library was published as `0.2.0` version. After releasing this version, I took back seat and no new features were developed by me. I only have been reviewing pull requests and releasing new versions. Also, I created a couple of issues in the GitHub repo for the community. One of these issues was to implement IPC client that uses UNIX sockets under the hood.

After releasing `0.2.0` version the library got much more popular and it has been getting more contributions from the community. I even was contacted by [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), they funded a couple of issues.

From October of 2017 to September of 2018 five more new versions with small features and fixes were released.

#### 0.4.0

At the beginning of October of 2018 [a new pull request](https://github.com/exthereum/ethereumex/pull/40) was submitted to the GitHub repository. It was IPC client implementation. This contribution is the biggest of all contributions to the project to date.

### Projects that use Ethereumex

- [elixir-omg](https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg) - OmiseGO's Elixir implementation of Plasma and forms the basis for the OMG Network.
- [eth](https://hex.pm/packages/eth) - Ethereum utilities for Elixir.
- [eth_contract](https://hex.pm/packages/eth_contract) - A set of helper methods for calling ETH Smart Contracts via JSON RPC.
- [exw3](https://hex.pm/packages/exw3) - A high level Ethereum JSON RPC Client for Elixir

### Conclusion

At the beginning of this article is an illustration of [the Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel). It's not accidental. In my opinion, open source community (GitHub) is like this tower - people are working together to create something wonderful. I hope big corporations (Microsoft) won't destroy it.
